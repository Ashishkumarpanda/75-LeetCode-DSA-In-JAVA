## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. It includes solutions to a variety of problems ranging from basic to advanced levels. Each solution is implemented in Java and is accompanied by detailed comments to help understand the approach and logic used.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `arrays/`: Solutions to problems related to arrays.
- `linkedlists/`: Solutions to problems related to linked lists.
- `stacks/`: Solutions to problems related to stacks.
- `queues/`: Solutions to problems related to queues.
- `trees/`: Solutions to problems related to trees.
- `graphs/`: Solutions to problems related to graphs.
- `hashing/`: Solutions to problems related to hashing.
- `sorting/`: Solutions to sorting algorithms.
- `searching/`: Solutions to searching algorithms.
- `misc/`: Solutions to miscellaneous problems.

Each directory contains Java files corresponding to individual problems. The filenames are descriptive of the problem they solve.
