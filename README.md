# DSA Java Repository

Welcome to the DSA Java repository! This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions that I have solved while practicing DSA in Java. It serves as a comprehensive collection of solutions and a reference for anyone looking to understand and implement various DSA concepts in Java.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. It includes solutions to a variety of problems ranging from basic to advanced levels. Each solution is implemented in Java and is accompanied by detailed comments to help understand the approach and logic used.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `arrays/`: Solutions to problems related to arrays.
- `linkedlists/`: Solutions to problems related to linked lists.
- `stacks/`: Solutions to problems related to stacks.
- `queues/`: Solutions to problems related to queues.
- `trees/`: Solutions to problems related to trees.
- `graphs/`: Solutions to problems related to graphs.
- `hashing/`: Solutions to problems related to hashing.
- `sorting/`: Solutions to sorting algorithms.
- `searching/`: Solutions to searching algorithms.
- `misc/`: Solutions to miscellaneous problems.

Each directory contains Java files corresponding to individual problems. The filenames are descriptive of the problem they solve.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have solved additional DSA problems in Java or have improvements to the existing solutions, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your code follows the same structure and commenting style as the rest of the repository.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to contact me at ashishkumarpanda257@gmail.com.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Java.git

Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to run and compile the Java file using the `javac` command:

```bash
javac ProblemName.java

Then, run the compiled Java program using the java command:
java ProblemName

Make sure to replace ProblemName with the actual name of the Java file you want to execute.
